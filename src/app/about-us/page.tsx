                  The National Society of Black Engineers was founded in 1975 by six visionary students at Purdue University. Known as the &quot;Chicago Six,&quot; these students &mdash; Edward Coleman, Anthony Harris, Brian Harris, Stanley Kirtley, John Logan Jr., and George Smith &mdash;  saw the need for a support network to address the underrepresentation of Black students in engineering programs, and were determined to create an organization that would promote academic success and increase the number of Black engineers.
